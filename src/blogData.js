        contentPartOne: "Some already have seen this coming in 2020 after Google acquired Looker for no less then $2,6 billion, that eventually everything related to advanced data analytics was going to become branded with Looker.<br/><br/>Google recently even updated the url from datastudio.google.com to lookerstudio.google.com, to show us that we currently all living in the Looker era of advanced data analytics products from Google.</BR></BR>So what are new features exactly - did they upgrade on much needed features such as improving overall stability and made it load much faster when using blended data set? One of the most common complaints to date has been that the previous version of Datastudio simply was not(and still is not) fitted for companies that deal with large sums of data with more enterprise needs.</br></br> Simply put, in typical Google jargon the improvments are:",
        contentPartTwo:"To break it down in layman's terms: They have now introduced a Pro version that will enable enterprise management features, smoother collaboration capabilities, and more flexible data modelling features.<br/><br/> Another huge update is the ability to integrate Looker studio with core Google technologies like AI and ML. The plan that Google has set in motion for the future of Looker can be read from their recent blog post, which goes in depth how they want to expand the reach and utility of Looker to a wider audience.</br></br>h At the moment no official numbers have been given for the price of Looker Studio Pro, but if your organisation is already using Google Cloud Platform, you can complete their form and be notified when it will be available.

        contentPartOne: "ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) AI model developed by OpenAI. It has the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human-like responses to text-based inputs. Since its inception, it has been used in a wide range of applications, including language translation, chatbots, and content generation.<br/><br/>While there are many benefits to using ChatGPT, there is also some concern that this technology will replace human jobs. In this article, we will explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and whether it will replace human jobs.<br/><br/>What is ChatGPT?<br/><br/>ChatGPT is a powerful AI language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of text. This training has given it the ability to generate human-like responses to text-based inputs. It can understand the nuances of language, including idioms, slang, and cultural references. Its abilities have led to the development of a wide range of applications.<br/><br/>Applications of ChatGPT<br/><br/>Chatbots: Chatbots are computer programs that can simulate conversations with humans. They are often used to provide customer service or answer common questions. ChatGPT has been used to power chatbots that can provide personalized responses to customers.<br/><br/>Language Translation: ChatGPT can be used to translate text from one language to another. This technology has the potential to break down language barriers and facilitate communication between people who speak different languages.<br/><br/>Content Generation: ChatGPT has been used to generate content for a wide range of applications, including news articles, product descriptions, and even creative writing. It can analyze a dataset and generate new content that is similar in style and tone.",
        contentQuoteOne:"\“While AI technology like ChatGPT will certainly change the way we work, it is unlikely to replace humans entirely. Rather than replacing jobs, it has the potential to create new opportunities and require us to adapt to new ways of working.\“",
        contentPartTwo:"Will ChatGPT Replace Human Jobs?<br/><br/>The concern that ChatGPT will replace human jobs is understandable. After all, it has the ability to do many tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans. However, the reality is more nuanced.<br/><br/>While ChatGPT can perform many tasks, it still has limitations. It is not capable of understanding complex emotions or reasoning through complex problems. While it can generate responses that sound human-like, it is not a substitute for the creativity and originality that humans bring to the table.<br/><br/>In fact, the development of ChatGPT has the potential to create new jobs. For example, companies that develop chatbots will need people to create, maintain, and improve those chatbots. Similarly, the development of new applications for ChatGPT will require people with the skills to develop and implement those applications.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the relationship between ChatGPT and human jobs will be complex. There is no doubt that this technology will change the way we work, but it is unlikely to replace humans entirely. Instead, it will create new opportunities and require us to adapt to new ways of working.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>ChatGPT is a powerful technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate. Its ability to generate human-like responses to text-based inputs has led to the development of a wide range of applications. While there is concern that ChatGPT will replace human jobs, the reality is more nuanced. While it will certainly change the way we work, it is unlikely to replace humans entirely.
